1. Remove Chartjunk: 
  Romoved x and y axis, moved titles closer to graph to make image more compact, used natural colour palatte with no patterns or borders.

2. Utulize Data-ink:
  Removed x and y axis, made bars with only three 'Number of 5s' values more narrow compaired to ones with four, removed all dog breeds     that did not score at least a 3 on the 'Number of 5s' axis.  

3. Use Labels: 
  Named each dog breed that had at least 3/5 number 5's on the graph under thier bar.

4. Utulize Micro: 
  Removed all dog breed entries that scored a 2/5 or below to eliminate the least desirable breeds.

5. Seperate Layers:
  The bars that indicate dog breeds that scored 4/5 5s in our research are thicker, and a darker shade of green than the bars for the dog   breeds that only scored 3/5
